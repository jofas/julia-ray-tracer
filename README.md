# Julia set ray tracing shader

Mostly a portation of Keenan Crane's implementation from
his paper [Ray Tracing Quaternion Julia Sets on the GPU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/QuaternionJulia/paper.pdf) to [Unity](https://unity3d.com).

Also useful: [Quaternion Julia Fractals](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/quatjulia/) by Paul Bourke.
